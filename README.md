# Predicting-and-classifying-whether-text-messages-are-spam-or-not
Natural Language processing machine learning model was created to distinguish real messages from spam messages. It accurately predicted 962 different text messages and 150 incorrect ones out of 1110 text messages. Naive Bayes classification method was used.

Dataset was imported from Kaggle. I have uploaded the dataset in the github (spam.tsv)
